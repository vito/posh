template system mockup:

  {{ foo }}:
    look for the nearest 'foo' key (i.e. lexical scoping) and bring it in

  {{ foo.bar.baz }}:
    look for the nearest 'foo' key and get attributes on it

    if foo.bar is nil, return nil

  {{ "foo" }}:
    string literal

  {{ "foo" + bar }}
    string concatenation (where bar is another arbitrary expr)

  {{ auto }}:
    context-sensitive; in a resource pool's instances: this means calculate
    based on the # of jobs declared in the pool

  {{ merge }}:
    bring the current path in from the template being diff'd against

    e.g.:

    foo:
      bar:
        baz: {{ merge }}

    will bring in {{ foo.bar.baz }}

    if the corresponding value is not defined, it will return nil

  {{ a || b }}:
    uses a or b if a is nil

  {{ static_ips(N, "cf1.static") }}:
    generate N static IPs in the cf1.static network, returning an array of
    strings
